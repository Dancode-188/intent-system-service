# ISaaS Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

ISaaS follows a layered microservices architecture designed for scalability, privacy, and real-time processing. Each layer serves a specific purpose while maintaining strict privacy boundaries.

## Architectural Layers

### 1. Client Layer
- Web Application (React + D3.js)
- Mobile Applications
- Third-party Integrations
- Handles user interactions and data visualization
- Implements client-side privacy filtering

### 2. API Gateway Layer
- FastAPI-based gateway service
- Handles:
  - Request routing
  - Authentication & Authorization
  - Rate limiting
  - Request validation
  - Privacy header verification
  - Basic request sanitization

### 3. Core Services Layer

#### Context Service
- Analyzes user context using BERT
- Handles:
  - Context extraction
  - Privacy-aware feature processing
  - Context classification
- Technology: FastAPI + BERT

#### Intent Service
- Processes user intent patterns
- Implements:
  - Graph-based intent analysis
  - Pattern recognition
  - Privacy-preserving graph operations
- Technology: FastAPI + NetworkX

#### Prediction Service
- Generates privacy-aware predictions
- Features:
  - Pattern-based prediction
  - Anomaly detection
  - Confidence scoring
- Technology: FastAPI + Scikit-learn

#### Real-time Service (Planned)
- Handles real-time updates
- Will implement:
  - WebSocket connections
  - Real-time pattern updates
  - Live predictions
- Technology: Node.js + Socket.io

### 4. Data Layer

#### Current Implementation
- In-memory processing for initial phase
- Temporary storage with privacy constraints
- Structured data handling

#### Planned Extensions
- Vector Database (FAISS/Pinecone)
- Graph Database (Neo4j)
- Time Series Database (TimescaleDB)

## System Interaction Flow

1. Client makes request through API Gateway
2. Gateway validates and routes request
3. Services process request maintaining privacy:
   - Context Service analyzes user context
   - Intent Service processes patterns
   - Prediction Service generates insights
4. Results returned through Gateway
5. Client receives privacy-preserved response

## Privacy Considerations

- Data minimization at every layer
- Privacy filtering at Gateway
- Anonymized processing in services
- Temporary data retention
- Secure communication between services

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed
- API Gateway
- Context Service
- Intent Service
- Prediction Service
- Basic privacy measures

### In Progress
- Documentation
- Deployment procedures
- Extended privacy features

### Planned
- Real-time Service
- Advanced databases
- Enhanced monitoring

## Performance Characteristics

### Current Metrics
- API Gateway latency: ~50ms
- Service processing time: ~100-150ms
- Total request time: ~150-200ms

### Target Metrics
- API requests: < 100ms (p95)
- Real-time updates: < 50ms
- ML inference: < 200ms

## Deployment Architecture

### Development
- Local Docker containers
- In-memory processing
- Local service discovery

### Production (Planned)
- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
- Containerized services
- Managed databases
- Monitoring stack

## Next Steps

1. Complete service documentation
2. Implement deployment procedures
3. Add monitoring and observability
4. Enhance privacy features
5. Integrate planned databases
