# Intent System as a Service (ISaaS)

A sophisticated, privacy-preserving intent analysis system that revolutionizes how digital platforms understand and serve their users.

## Overview

ISaaS provides real-time user intent analysis while maintaining strict privacy standards. The system uses advanced ML models and graph processing to understand user behavior patterns without compromising personal data.

## Key Features

- Privacy-First Intent Analysis
- Real-Time Pattern Recognition
- Secure Graph Processing
- Privacy-Preserving Predictions
- Scalable Architecture
- Comprehensive API Integration
